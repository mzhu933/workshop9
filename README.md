## - Problem Solving Note：
At first, I wanted to create a diamond shaped design, but it didn’t work out as planned. While using VSCodium, the live preview feature failed to run properly. As a result, I decided to delete what I had done and started over by following the workshop video step by step. I replicated the example exactly as shown in the video, but the live preview still didn’t work.

Initially, I thought the issue was related to Mac’s camera permissions. However, I later discovered that I needed to click on the “Go Live” button in the bottom right corner of VSCodium. This action opened a browser, where I could then enable the camera to make it work properly.

## - Improve
I decided to improve upon it by replacing the ball system with a square system, which gave the design a mosaic-like effect. While this was visually interesting, it still felt a bit monotonous, so I added a slider to make it more interactive and dynamic.

- Mosaic grids, transparency sliders—building bridges between randomness and choice.

## - Reflection
Interacting with the camera felt like creating a dialogue between the digital world and the user. The moving mosaic of squares turned live visuals into something dynamic and textured, almost like translating reality into fragmented art. Adding the slider gave it a personal touch, allowing for playful experimentation with transparency and depth.

## - Further Development 
I'm actually not very comfortable with opening the front facing camera. I want to directly upload a video in p5.js, then pixelate the video and turn it into an animation. Maybe I could add some randomness or other interactive elements.
